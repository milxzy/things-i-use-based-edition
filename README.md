## ✨ Fonts (Code Drip)
the real reason my code looks clean.

- [JetBrains Mono](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/#how-to-install) to make boomers feel at home
- [Berkeley Mono](https://berkeleygraphics.com/typefaces/berkeley-mono/) paid, but makes you feel elite
- [Mononoki](https://madmalik.github.io/mononoki/) when I’m in my cozy hacker arc
- [Monaspace](https://monaspace.githubnext.com/) GitHub made a font, and it's kinda based tbh

## ⏳ Productivity 
or how i trick myself into thinking im doing stuff
- [Pomotui](https://github.com/charlieroth/pomotui) CLI pomodoro if you're allergic to windows
- [Flow](https://www.flow.app/) looks cool while i scroll twitter
- ☕ a crippling caffeine addiction (better than any app)
- [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) like notion, but without the “here’s my second brain 🤓” energy.
- [cobalt.tools](https://cobalt.tools/) if you aren't technologically literate to use yt-dlp, or you are on someone else's computer.

## 🎮 Periphreals
because input devices = my personality
